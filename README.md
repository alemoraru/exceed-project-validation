# EXCEED Project Validation

This repository is designed for evaluating the effectiveness of prompt templates and language models in rephrasing error
messages for buggy code snippets. The web application allows users to select different models and prompt styles,
generate improved error messages, and provide feedback on their quality. All feedback is stored locally and can be
exported for further analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running locally
- Download the desired Ollama models on your machine before using the app (models must be available locally). More
  specifically, the following models are used for validation and need to be downloaded:
    - [`qwen2.5:7b`](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5:7b)
    - [`granite3.3:8b`](https://ollama.com/library/granite3.3:8b)
    - [`llama3.1:8b`](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.1:8b) (but this should not be used for validation, only for
      comparison purposes)
